# Neovim in Unity

for some reason I cant get cspoj files generation working on windows

This package provides integration of neovim as an external editor in Unity.

## Installation

### Clone this repo

``git clone https://github.com/the-argus/com.unity.ide.neovim-windows.git``

### Install the package

Open Unity. Go to Window > Package Manager and select the "+" sign at the top
left of the window. From the dropdown, select "Add package from disk". Browse
and select the ``package.json`` file at the root of this repo.

### Select Neovim as the editor

Go to Edit > Preferences > External Tools.
Set "External Script Editor" to "Neovim" in the dropdown menu. If it's not
present, then select "browse" and select the file ``run.sh`` at the root of
this repo.

### Customize nvim-remote

It's necessary to customize the ``nvim-remote`` file to fit your needs. Open it and
make sure the ``term_exec`` variable matches your own terminal emulator.

#### Flatpak Fix

Sometimes using this with flatpak requires you to run
``sudo flatpak override com.unity.UnityHub --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak``.
